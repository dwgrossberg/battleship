## Objectives & Challenges

The main goal of this project was to build a small game app by utilizing the principles of test-driven-development. This was my first experience with any type of unit testing and it really made me restructure my workflow, especially at the start of the project. Instead of branching out in a dozen directions at once, creating unit tests forced me to slow down and focus on writing technically sound code, one module at a time. This approach was a challenge for me, particularly in the beginning, but I stuck with it long enough to see the clear benefits and value of TDD. While the project did take a little longer to get off the ground, once I finalized my unit-tested modules, the rest of the app was far simpler to complete. I was able to focus on the design and execution of the project, without needing to make awkward/painful adjustments to the core logic after the fact. In the end, I believe that the process absolutely helped me to create a stronger and leaner application, while also improving the overall quality of my code production.
